The Tox21 data set comprises 12,060 training samples 
and 647 test samples that represent chemical compounds. 
There are 801 "dense features" that represent chemical descriptors, 
such as molecular weight, solubility or surface area, and 272,776 "sparse features" 
that represent chemical substructures (ECFP10, DFS6, DFS8; stored in 
Matrix Market Format ). Machine learning methods can either use sparse or 
dense data or combine them. 
For each sample there are 12 binary labels that represent 
the outcome (active/inactive) of 12 different toxicological experiments. 
Note that the label matrix contains many missing values (NAs).
